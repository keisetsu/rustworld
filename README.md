# rustworld
A roguelike alike that takes inspiration from a certain game involving species-jumping cordyceps.

I hope to focus on stealth and scavaging, rather than combat and/or running away.

This is also my attempt at learning rust; I've run through most of the excellent [libtcod + rust tutorial](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/), and now I'm working on extending it to my ideas.
